Breeze includes a simple &quot;profile&quot; page where the user may update their name, email address, and password. 

This project is trying to use <b>Next.js full-stack functionalities emulating Laravel Breeze</b>.
Laravel Breeze&apos;s default view layer is made up of simple Blade templates styled with Tailwind CSS. The Next.js React front pages are also styled with Tailwind CSS to follow Laravel Breeze&apos;s view designs.
In this project, Prisma as an ORM is used to manage the database, as Eloquent is adopted to connect Laravel with the database.
